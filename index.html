    <p>ðŸŒŸ <strong>Happy Birthday, Dora Bora ðŸ’›</strong> ðŸŒŸ</p>

    <p>Hey my sweetest Dora Bora,</p>

    <p>
      I donâ€™t even know where to begin, because words feel so small compared to the place you hold in my heart. But
      today is
      <strong>your day</strong> â€” your birthday â€” and I want to pour out every ounce of appreciation, love, and
      gratitude I feel for
      having you in my life.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the moment we became friends, everything changed in the best way. You didnâ€™t just walk into my life, you made
      a home in my
      heart â€” and ever since, youâ€™ve filled my days with laughter, comfort, support, and a kind of friendship thatâ€™s so
      rare and
      precious </p>


    <p>
      <strong>Happy Birthday, my Dora Bora ðŸ’«</strong> May your year ahead be as beautiful and magical as you are.
    </p>

    <p>With all my love,</p>
    <p><strong>Your forever friend,</strong><br>Nikita ðŸ’›</p>
